**Working report â€“ 3DZhed game**

The computer graphics lab project of Itay Har-Shuv - 3D zhed game
The game is an extension to the game zhed which can be found in google play or the app store. The extension is the implementation of the game over different 3D quad meshes. The game was created via unity. In addition, to learn unity better, I decided to make the 2048 game and the 2D version of the game. After doing those games, I started implement the 3D game but only on grided cube. I that by creating different mesh for every cell, locate it in the right place and adding the uv of the number/empty cell. I connected every cell to its neighbors made the cell open and so on. I added restart and undo buttons. After finishing implement the game on a grided cube, I made it for every quad mesh. This I did by uploading a quad mesh to blender, then put it through a code in python that gave me the list of vertices and squares of the mesh. Via those lists I was able to create the mesh myself in unity and play the game on it.

**Week Progression**

week 1: Writing the game description page, start practice simple basics of unity

week 2: I had started implementing the 2D version of the game and made the grid and such. After a while, I decided to get a better understanding of unity by implementing 2048 game from a tutorial in YouTube and finished the 2048 implementation

week 3: I start and finished implementing the 2D version of Zhed after learning a little bit more about unity to learn and practice more. It can be seen under 2Dzhed - remastered. I can add restart button, undo button, more levels etc. But I want to move to the final 3D version of the game.

week 4: I started implement the 3D version of the game, I've done a grided (on every face) cube that I can put numbers on its cells.

week 5: No progress this week due to other obligations.

week 6: Upgrade the design a little, made the cube roll with WDSA keys and made the cells open properly with undo and restart buttons.

week 7: No progress this week due to other obligations.

week 8: No progress this week due to other obligations.

week 9: Added rotation via buttons

week 10: No progress this week due to other obligations.

week 11: No progress this week due to other obligations.

week 12: Added win cell and designed 7 levels

week 13: Made the possibility the play the game on every quad mesh surface
